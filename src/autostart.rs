///    manifest declares `windows.startupTask` instead, which is also what puts
///    the on/off switch in Task Manager where users expect to find it.
/// 2. **We cannot elevate ourselves.** `elevate_self` re-launches
///    `current_exe()`, which here is under `%ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps\` — a
///    directory whose ACL exists precisely to stop that.
/// 3. **The inbound rule is not ours to add either.** That same path carries the
